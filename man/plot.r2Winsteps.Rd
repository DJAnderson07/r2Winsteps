\usage{
\method{plot}{r2Winsteps}(ob, type = "TIF", rel = TRUE, theta = seq(-4, 4,
  0.1), itemSelect = NULL, colors = NULL, legend = TRUE, store = FALSE,
  grid = TRUE, gridCol = "gray80", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ob}{Objects of class r2Winsteps}

\item{type}{The type of plot to produce. Valid values are "TIF", "IIFs", 
"CSEM", "TCC", "ICCs" "ICP", "thresholds", and "ipDens". These
correspond to, respectively, the test information function, item information
functions, the conditional standard error of measure curves, the test 
characteristic curve, item characteristic curves, item-category 
probabilities, Thurstonion thresholds, and overlayed item and 
person densities. Note that ICP and Thresholds are only available for 
polytomous models. When specifying \code{lty} or \code{lwd} for "iDens", a 
vector (of length 2) must be supplied, corresponding to each distribution. 
Defaults to "TIF".}

\item{rel}{When \code{type == "TIF"}, should the distribution be shaded 
according to reliability? Defaults to \code{TRUE} and shades the
distribution according to 0.8 and 0.7 reliabilities.}

\item{theta}{Theta values from which the information function values are 
calculated from. Defaults to a sequence from -4 to 4 by 0.1. The limits of 
this range are used for the x-axes.}

\item{itemSelect}{Items to be used in the plotting. Defaults to NULL, in
which case all items will be used.}

\item{colors}{Line colors for the plot. Defaults to NULL, in which case the
colors match the defaults from ggplot.}

\item{store}{Optional logical argument to return data used in plotting 
(not available for all plot types). For example, when \code{store = TRUE}
and \code{type = "TIF"}, information under the specified theta range will be
returned.}

\item{grid}{Optional grid for interpreting graphs. Defaults to TRUE, in 
which case the graph is produced with a grid.}

\item{gridCol}{Optional color function for grid. Defaults to "gray80", in 
which case the graph is produced with a "gray80" color grid.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{plot}}.}
