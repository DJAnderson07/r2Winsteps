# r2Winsteps
This is a working package to move R files to Winsteps (with data and control files automatically written) and batch process files. This package is not intended to be all-encompassing, and provide all the features available to Winsteps users. Rather, the package is intended to automate many of the commonly applied models within Winsteps (e.g., Rasch Model, Masters' Partial Credit Model, Rating Scale Model).

The package is being actively developed, with changes made on a near daily basis.
