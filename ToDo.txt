# To Do
1. Update threshold plot to accommodate rating scale model.
2. Update batchRunWinsteps with the same updates that have been made to runWinsteps (i.e., have it check the length of the file before reading it in, and allow dems to be optional). 
3. Add person/item density plot
4. Add category information plot
5. Add function to read in person and items concurrently (to help with plotting functions being more automatic)
6. Check on warning about “ “ code showing up twice.
7. When type = “ICP”, it looks like the legend is being written over with each pass of the loop
8. Look at commented out code in plot. Uncomment and fix. When the number of categories is 1, the sapply on lines 119 - 124 doesn’t work.
