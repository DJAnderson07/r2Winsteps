Description: The `r2Winsteps` package was developed to provide a convenient
    interface between *R* and the Rasch modeling software *Winsteps*. The package
    is not intended to encompass the full capabilities of *Winsteps*, but rather
    to provide a simple framework for estimating many commonly applied models.
    The primary functions, `runWinsteps()` takes a matrix or data frame of item
    responses and person demographics, and writes and executes a .bat file to run
    the analysis through Winsteps. Person and item parameter estimates are then
    returned to R.
